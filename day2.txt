Thiss is a txt file with lots of erros and typos.
It should looks really bad, so you can pratice fixing it on VIm.

Somelines dont even have spaces
likeThisone right here.

other lines have too many spaces.


Some lInes have bad Capitalization.
others have Missing punctuation
and some have unwanted symbols!!!@@

The goal is too make this text clean and readble
and to use only delete (d), change (c), and replace (r) commands.

you can also try undo and redo to test your memory muscle in vim
